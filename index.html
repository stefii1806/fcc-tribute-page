      <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a timeline of her life:</h3>
      <ul class="tl-list">
        <li><b>1815:</b> she's born on December 10th, the only child of the renowned poet, George Gordon the 6th, also known as Lord Byron, and his wife, Anne Isabella Millbanke, Baroness Wentworth.</li>
        <li><b>1816:</b> on April 21st her parents separate.</li>
        <li><b>1824:</b> her father dies on April 19th.</li>
        <li><b>1828:</b> after carefully observing and studying the anatomy of birds, she builds a set of wings.</li>
        <li><b>1829:</b> she's left paralyzed after a bout of measles and is confined to bed rest for about a year.</li>
        <li><b>1831:</b> she's able to walk with crutches.</li>
        <li><b>1833:</b> she has an affair with a tutor. After being caught, she tries to elope with him, but her mother and her friends cover the incident up to prevent a scandal. She's introduced to Charles Babbage the same year. Later that month
          he
          invites her to see the prototype for his difference engine.</li>
        <li><b>1835:</b> she marries William, 8th Baron King, and becomes "Lady King".</li>
        <li><b>1836:</b> she gives birth to Byron on May 12th.</li>
        <li><b>1837:</b> she gives birth to daughter Anne Isabella (22 September).</li>
        <li><b>1838:</b> she becomes "Countess of Lovelace."</li>
        <li><b>1839:</b> she gives birth to her youngest son, Ralph Gordon.</li>
        <li><b>1842 -1843:</b> she translates an article written by Italian mathematician, Luigi Menabrea, about Babbage's new proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. She adds notes explaining how the machine works and the differences between that
          one and the original Difference Engine. In those notes, she she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for
          implementation
          on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the <em>first computer programmer</em> for this reason.</li>
        <li><b>1852:</b> she dies from uterine cancer at age 36.</li>
      </ul>
